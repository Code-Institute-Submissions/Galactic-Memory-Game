## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://chris92vr.github.io/Galactic-Memory-Game/).

## UX
 
A memory game for people of all ages (from child to adult), able to teach the appearance and names of the planets (and some satellites).
In total there are 12 cards to match. Each successful pair earns 10 points, each wrong attempt two are deducted. The game ends when all cards are matched, or if you don't have enough points to complete the game with a positive score. You win if you finish with a positive score.
Once the game is finished, the respective message (you won or lost) appears with the final score and a button to restart the game.
### User stories

1. As a new player, I want to easily start the game. 
2. As a new player, I want to see the actual score
3. As a new player, I want to restart the game at any time
4. As a potential client, I want it to be compatible on any screen resolution.
5. As a potential client, I want that works well on any browser, even mobile. 

### Strategy
My goal in design was to make it intuitive and easy to interact to make the gaming experience better.

### Scope
Learn the names of the planets while having fun.

### Design and colors:

#### Fonts:

I used Permanent Marker, from Google Fonts for the initial title of the game.


#### Colors:

* ![#0040c8](https://placehold.it/15/0040c8/000000?text=+) #0040c8 - hover buttons background color

* ![#fff](https://placehold.it/15/fff/000000?text=+) #fff - font color buttons and planets name retro cards

* ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) black - color of the score and the final message

* ![#adff2f](https://placehold.it/15/adff2f/000000?text=+) greenyellow - color of the name of the matched cards

## Features

This game was developed thanks to HTML%, CSS3 asd Javascript's jquery library. Once the game is started, the cards are shown for three seconds. Once a card is clicked it shows the image with the respective name, if the card clicked later is the same it remains turned over, otherwise it turns over.
### Existing Features
- Start button - allows users to start the game
- Score - shows the user's current score
- Restart button - allows the user to restart the game at any time
- Card matching - each paired card becomes transparent and the name changes to orange
- End message - shows the user the final result with the respective score

### Features Left to Implement
- Implement different levels of difficulty to better test your memory. 
- Add sound effects 
- Record the best score
## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

Several tests were carried out to verify the correct functioning of the project with positive results.
The functionality of the site is optimal. Any link and button is active and leads to the corresponding destination.
Browser compatibility is verified for Firefox, Chrome and Edge. The responsiveness of the pages is suitable on desktop screens, tablets and mobile phones.
In the folder [project-documentation/testing](https://github.com/chris92vr/Galactic-Memory-Game/tree/master/project-documentation/testing), there are screenshots that show browser compatibility and responsiveness tests.


In order to to check the validity of the website code, I have used the following:

    - HTML Validation: https://validator.w3.org/ - no errors identified.
    - CSS Validation: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ - Identified issues with bootstrap not with my project. 

#### Functionality Test
|Test Description | Expected Outcome | Pass/Fail
| ---|:-----------------------------------------:| :---: | 
| start button| clear screen and start game| pass
| show cards | shows the cards for three seconds once the game is started| pass
| flip cards | the card flips on click, if it is not already rotated | pass
| card matching| select two cards, if they are the same they remain turned if they do not turn over| pass
| score | the score increases by 10 points for each card match and decreases by two for each wrong attempt | pass
| end game | the game ends when all matches have been found, or if you do not have enough cards available to make a positive score | pass
| end message | once the game is finished, a message appears with the final result and the score achieved | pass
| responsiveness| the game adapts to all screen resolutions and device | pass
| browser compatibility | the game works correctly on any browser | pass
